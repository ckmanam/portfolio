            <p>Alaska is my most recently visited travel destination outside of the continental United States. On our first full day in Alaska,
                we visited a nature conservatory that protects animals, the most exciting of which to see up close were the bears. 
                Afterward, we went on a rafting tour around a glacier. Throughout the tour, the weather was terrible, and the water was
                ice cold, but putting up with the cold temperatures was well worth the views.
            </p>

            <p>The third full day of the Alaska vacation was by far the most exciting. We took a helicopter tour across a glacier to land 
                on top of a mountain. The original helicopter lift-off point itself was visually stunning. After flying on the helicopter, 
                we finally landed where we went dog sledding. After dog sledding, on our way back, we landed on top of the glacier, and you 
                can see in the last photo just how blue the water is.
            </p>

            <p>The final few days of our trip to Alaska included driving to Denali National Park. On the drive there, we stopped
                to take an ATV tour and had some quiet time to walk next to a river. At Denali National Park, we took a bus tour 
                to one of the higher peaks, and the view was insane. Unfortunately, we weren't able to see Mt. Denali at the park due 
                to fog. However, in a nearby city, I was able to capture a long-distance photo of Mt. Denali.
