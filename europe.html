            <p>
                In July of 2019, I traveled to London and North Italy. On the first day of the trip, we traveled near the Thames River.
                We first traveled to the London Eye where we saw a complete aerial view of London and had a clear
                view of the Palace of Westminster. Afterward, we went on the classic double-decker bus tour in which we were 
                able to see the streets of London. Then, we went to Piccadilly Circus to walk around and visit shops.
            </p>

            <p>
                We then left London and traveled to Milan, Italy. On our first evening in Milan, we walked around and visited the Duomo 
                Cathedral, which was an architectural masterpiece. The next full day we had, we traveled to Venice, Italy. Venice is 
                called the 'Floating City' because the entire city is composed of canals and bridges. Here, I ate the best food I 
                have ever eaten in my life, which was pesto pasta with chicken. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The next few days, we took trips to Florence, Italy, and Lake Como. Florence is well known for its Renaissance art, and the
                museums did not disappoint. The most visually stunning piece of art in the entire city, in my opinion, was the statue 
                of David by Michelangelo because the statue was enormous and highly detailed. At Lake Como, we took a boat tour 
                to several small cities located on the lake. Seeing all of the houses built on the edge of the water was also 
                an amazing experience.
